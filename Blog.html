									<h2>The Power of Ongoing Learning: Lessons from Building My Own Website</h2>
									<p>March 2025</p>
								</header>

								<p>As a freelance technical writer, I spend a lot of time translating complex information into clear, structured content. But when I decided to launch my own business website, I found myself on the other side of the learning curve—navigating unfamiliar territory, troubleshooting unexpected challenges, and picking up new skills along the way.</p>
								<p>Building my website wasn't just about creating an online presence, it was a hands-on lesson in continuous learning. From choosing the right platform to understanding SEO basics, the experience reinforced just how essential adaptability and self-education are for freelancers. In this post, I'll share my journey, the key lessons I learned, and tips that might help others tackling a similar challenge.</p>
								<h3>Quick - I Need a Website to Put on my Business Card so that I can Network!</h3>
								<p>After diving in at the deep end and deciding to “go for it” as a freelancer, it was a little overwhelming trying to decide what to do first. I knew that my almost ten years as an employed technical author had provided me with a huge skillset, but that didn't include running my own business! </p>
								<p>I needed to network and find people that could offer advice, create opportunities, and get my name out there, so I signed up to a few networking events. Next, I needed a business card—but I didn't have a website! </p>
								<h3>OK, Let's Do This! What's First?</h3>
								<p>Since I'm naturally creative, I was in love with Canva from day one. So, I used one of their lovely website templates to get started. Great—I had a quick and snazzy website with moving patterns and backgrounds… oh, wait, that's going to slow download time, and isn't great for everyone to visualise. Hang on, how can I add my Google Analytics tag? And why can't I customise my website address? It was clear that “you get what you pay for” (or don't). </p>
								<p>So, next I got a little more serious and found some blogs, articles, and tutorials to figure out how I could make a “real” website. With a strong background writing in DITA XML format, I had already dabbled with html, although it was pretty painstaking to start writing a website from scratch. </p>
								<p>You might wonder why I didn't use a platform designed to do all the hard work for me, and I'm not sure I can fully answer that as I didn't really consider them. However, I know myself and I know that I like to take responsibility and do things properly—and actually, I relished the challenge!</p>
								<p>I bought my domain name from Namecheap, found a simple free template from HTML5UP, then downloaded Visual Studio Code and GitHub Desktop. After a lot of Google searches, I figured out what I was doing and created my first edition of russelltechnicalwriting.co.uk.</p>
								<p>After a few months of on-going learning and networking, I found out a bit more about SEO, accessibility, user experience, and marketing—and realised that I could do better. Once again, I set about learning even more. I searched online, found webinars, attended training sessions - Business Gateway have been amazing - and got stuck in. Hopefully, if you're reading this, it worked. This is my first blog post on the new website! Seven pages instead of one (which I'm told: was too text heavy up front, didn't have user-friendly text colours or sizing, had little information about my experiences, and no blog!)</p>
								<h3>Was it Worth the Effort?</h3>
								<p>As far as I'm concerned, I'm enjoying my learning journey immensely. Throughout life I have always followed the path that felt right at the time—not always the easiest one. My journey into freelancing was a huge leap of faith, and building my own website as a non-specialist web developer feels a bit like I'm learning to write my name for the first time in front of a global audience. I don't think I would have been brave enough to try that early in my career, but with a bit more maturity on my side, I have thankfully learned to care more about getting on with what I think is right for me instead of worrying about what others think. </p>
								<h3>Biggest Takeaway?</h3>
								<p>I'm not talking Chinese food here—although I do love a bit of Szechuan spice! The most important thing I have learned is how important it is to keep learning. There are so many opportunities out there to learn almost anything you want to. It doesn’t need to cost you lots of money or time. Some universities offer upscaling courses paid for by the government (in the UK). In the US, there are also universities that offer open courseware. Talk to people who are doing what you want to do and find out how they got there (web design, or anything else). You might not know how to do something YET, but if you keep trying, one day you will. </p>

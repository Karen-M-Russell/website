									<h1>How We Can Help<br />
									Your Company Thrive</h1>
									<p>We can help your business improve customer experience while reducing the expense of customer support.</p>

								<header><h2>Transform Your Mish-Mash of Information into a Masterpiece</h2>
								<p>Information Architecture</p>
								</header>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/9.png" alt="an image of people looking at an array of post-it notes" /></span>Has your legacy documentation become a "dumping ground"?</br>
									Do you have several authors/developers adding content without addressing duplication or redundant information?</br>
									Save time and effort. Let your developers do what they do best.</br>
									We can analyse and re-organise your documentation in a concise and logical format (while consulting your subject matter experts as required).</br>
									It's not a problem if you have information in different places or formats (including in someone's head). We are well-practiced at gathering and eliciting information, removing redundant material, and identifying then resolving gaps that you may not even realise exist.

								<p>Structured DITA XML</p>
								</header>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/DITA.jpg" alt="a graphic of a folder icon at the centre of a network of lines and dots" /></span>If you are contemplating translating your documentation into another language (or several), you can reduce costs by converting your documentation into DITA XML format. Only new and edited modular content needs to be sent for translation. Translate once, use repeatedly.</br> 
									DITA structure also promotes a consistent and easy-to-navigate layout which enhances user-experience.</br>
									We have experienced migrating vast quantities of documentation from unstructured writing to structured DITA format. We can confidently assist you (at any point in your DITA journey), with over six years of experience writing in DITA format.

								<h2>All Hands On Deck</h2>
								<p>Customer-Facing Documentation</p>
								</header>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/17.png" alt="an over-tired worker sleeping at a messy desk in front of a laptop" /></span>When you start scaling-up your business, there is a lot to do, and documentation is often neglected in favour of other things.</br>
									If your documentation isn't reliable, and you're too busy to address customer support queries, your customers might not stick around trying to figure things out. If they do, they won't be happy about it.</br>
									At scale-up stage, new customers will research you online. Great customer recommendations can help you grow, but reviews complaining about poor customer experience can put off new customers.</br>
									Free-up your valuable staff resources. Avoid hiring another permanent staff member.</br>
									We can work autonomously or dynamically within any team to document your products, software features, or services.</p>

								<h2>Avoid the "He Said", "She Said", "Who Said What?"</h2>
								<p>Internal Documentation</p>
								</header>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/8.png" alt="a lady sitting at a desk with her head in her hands" /></span>Start-up companies often manage quite well with a small team who understand all aspects of the company. Initially, the small team doesn't need to document anything - they know what they are doing. However, after a while, the team grows and those with the knowledge of the company are busy growing the company. Someone needs to pass on critical information to the team. Of course, you can do this verbally, make some videos, or ask AI to write what you tell it to.</br>
								Are you confident that covers everything? Have you missed anything? Are you getting distracted by persistent interruptions from staff members who just don't understand what you need from them? They haven't been there from the start and even the most committed staff member won't be as invested as you are.</br>
								We can create your internal documentation of processes, procedures, and training to help your staff share your company values and feel part of the team.</p>
